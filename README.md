# One Libraray to Rule Them All
## IsEven.js

I started this project as a hobby but quickly turned it into a public repo just for the good of humanity

### My Goal:
Hard code every single number in existance into a single function.
This way none of your precious processing power will be lost in calculating modulus' of numbers.

    n%2 == 0 is for losers
    
### How to contribute?

Run the porvides generator script for as long as you like, pipe its input into the data.txt file.
From there copy and paste the generated cases into the main.js file to increase the number of cases.

My goal for this library for 2020 is hard-coding 10 billion cases. Help be in my quest.
